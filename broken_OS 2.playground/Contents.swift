 # Welcome to brokenOS!
 
A couple of things:
* Be patient. The program is meant to emulate an old computer, so slow text animation is on purpose.
* Go in order.  When you have the option to select an application, please go in order.
* Have fun! There is definitely some cool stuff I am proud of in here. I wish I could've added more, but I was on a time crunch.
## Overview
 brokenOS is a fake terminal, styled after older computers, with a unique experience and many activities.  You can play trivia, learn about me, and get taken over by an AI overlord.  It is quirky, but fun to fool around with.  Always follow on screen instrructions, careful, you might see some bugs along the way :D.
 
 Thank you so much for taking the time to review this playground, at a time like this, everybody's lives have been turned upside down and it is so nice tto step back and have fun and enjoy this amazing tradition.  This is my fourth year trying for the scholarship, and although usually because of time, I fail pretty epically, I always learn and have a ton of fun doing it.  I hope this is the year I get to see you, maybe virtually, at WWDC! Stay safe!
